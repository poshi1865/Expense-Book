I wrote this during college for the Android app dev course. 
The app works (or atleast used to) and proved quite helpful in college for tracking my expenditure. I could open the app any day and see my expenditure for the month.

The idea is not too bad, and sometimes I wonder if I should write this again - but cleaner and cross platform.
Also, tracking expenses through messages is unreliable, the better way is going through the Accounts Aggregator Framework.
